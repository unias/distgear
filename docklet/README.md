## Intro

Docklet is a container-based cloud platform that provides container cluster services for multi-tenant in a shared cluster. A container cluster consists of several Linux Containers(LXC) connected with each other by a virtual network. Each user could apply and utilize a container cluster resource via a web browser. The original Docklet is developed based on RPC. We implement a simple version of DistGear-based Docklet here that includes some basic features. We show how DistGear works for developing a real distributed application. For detailed information about Docklet project, please visit Docklet's website.
